        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>Magic is a card game where two people face each other with decks of 60 cards.
            Each player has 20 life and when that hits 0, that player loses.
            To reduce each other's life total, each player has creatures that can attack players
            and block other creatures. Finally every turn a player may play 1 land. Land can be 
            tapped in order to pay the cost of cards.
        </p>

        <h2>The Five Colors</h2>
        <p>There are 5 colors in this game, White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green. Each color can be
            paid for with its type of lands. Each does their own things in game but each is based on something.
            White is about law, order, and community. Blue is about intellect and gathering knowledge, red is 
            about emotion. Black is about self-interest. Green is about nature.
