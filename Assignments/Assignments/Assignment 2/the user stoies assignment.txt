Child report card tracker
client: Sunnyville Preschool
background: We are a day care. Parents have have told us that they want to see a daily report of how there kid
is behaving. They want to see if there were any issues or notes our teachers made.
priorities:
	- Many of our teachers are older and not technically savvy
	- Parents want their report card to mobile friendly so they can check on the go
