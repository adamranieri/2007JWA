You have to create a backend API for a banking application. This application is designed to allow users to perform CRUD operations
to a database.

An API is a way for someone to communicate with your program. Think of a Scanner. However we will be using HTTP and 
web servers.

*we have not covered APIs yet. However you will still be able to create DAOs and services and tests


- technical requirements
Application must follow Controller - Service - DAO layering and be coded to interfaces
The API must follow RESTful Naming conventions.
Every Service and DAO method must be tested in JUnit 
Every URL endpoint must have a postman test

There are two resources for this REST API (you will be recieving a more detailed breakdown when we cover APIs monday)
- customers
- Accounts

customers have accounts 

customer attributes
	- cId
	- username
	- password
	- array of accounts

account attributes
	- aId
	- cId (owner of the account)
	- account name i.e "My Savings" or "Vacation Fund"
	- balance

*negative balances are not allowed this should cause an exception

Bonus
- Transaction Resource
	- this resource keeps track of updates to the balance of customers accounts

- Transaction attributes
	- tId
	- aId (account this transaction is part of)
	- prevBalance
	- finalBalance
	- amount
