Pizza order tracker
client: Joes Pizza
background: When people call in to place orders the only way we have to track them is to write them down on pieces of paper.
We want an application for our employees to log orders. We want our cooking staff to see what orders are pending and when
the order is supposed to be done.
priorities:
	- Our staff is very busy and the interface needs to be as quick as possible to use
	- The cooking staff needs to be alert to orders allergen restrictions so that special precautions are taken
